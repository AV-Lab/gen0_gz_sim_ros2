# EZmile-Gen0

## *** EZmile-Gen0 Simulation ***
This section provides instructions on how to run the simulation of the vehicle. It is highly recommended to run the simulation on a computer system with Ubuntu 20.04 operating system installed. In addition, it is also recommended to use the ROS Noetic distribution. as it has been tested and found to work optimally on this particular setup.

### 1) Workspace setup

**Clone the repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/AV-Lab/ezmile_gen0
```
**ROS Packages**
```
# You can run the rospackages.sh file via terminal which contains all requried ros packages (noetic) 
cd ezmile_gen0
sudo chmod +x rospackages.sh
./rospackages.sh
```
**Install dependencies**
```
cd ezmile_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
```
**lightsfm package build**
```
cd src/lightsfm
make
sudo make install
```
**Build & source the workspace**
```
cd ezmile_ws
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```
### 2) Running the Simulation

**Spawn the vehicle in a small city world**
```
roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_spawn.launch
```
The launch file will start the following: 
1) Catvehicle.launch which spawns the vehicle and its releative Xacros/Urdfs
2) points_to_scan as the ouster lidar produces pointcloud which gets converted to scan
3) move_base.launch for the navigation stack
4) Rviz for visualization 

**Set a navigation goal on RVIZ**

**Optional: to run gmapping in a new .world file**

1) Update world_name variable in the catvehicle_empty.launch file to the new world created 
```
<arg name="world_name" value="$(find catvehicle)/worlds/plane.world"/>
```
2) Save and run catvehicle empty launch file
```
roslaunch catvehicle catvehicle_empty.launch
```
3) Launch points cloud to scan file
```
roslaunch catvehicle points_to_scan.launch
```
4) Run the gmapping launch file
```
roslaunch catvehicle gen0_gmapping.launch
```
5) Move the vehicle around by writing to cmd_vel topic or using a joystick to create the map
```
roslaunch catvehicle joystick.launch
```
6) Save the map
```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f my_map
```
**Optional: Add more pedestrians to the world**
1) Open the .world file you want to modify
2) Add the following tag
```
<actor name="actor1">
  <pose>2 3 1.213800 0 0 0</pose>
  <skin>
    <filename>moonwalk.dae</filename>
    <scale>1.0</scale>
  </skin>
  <animation name="walking">
    <filename>walk.dae</filename>
    <scale>1.000000</scale>
    <interpolate_x>true</interpolate_x>
  </animation>
  <!-- plugin definition -->
  <plugin name="actor1_plugin" filename="libPedestrianSFMPlugin.so">
    <velocity>1</velocity>
    <radius>0.4</radius>
    <animation_factor>5.1</animation_factor>
    <people_distance>6.0</people_distance>
    <!-- weights -->
    <goal_weight>2.0</goal_weight>
    <obstacle_weight>80.0</obstacle_weight>
    <social_weight>15</social_weight>
    <group_gaze_weight>3.0</group_gaze_weight>
    <group_coh_weight>2.0</group_coh_weight>
    <group_rep_weight>1.0</group_rep_weight>
    <ignore_obstacles>
      <model>ground_plane</model>
      <model>sidewalk_16</model>
    </ignore_obstacles>
    <trajectory>
      <cyclic>true</cyclic>
      <waypoint>40 8 1.213800</waypoint>
      <waypoint>40 -8 1.213800</waypoint>
    </trajectory>
  </plugin>
  </actor>
```
3) Modify the way points for the pedestrian path

## *** EZmile-Gen0 Communication ***

This segment will explain about starting hardware communication with EZmile Gen 0, there are however requirements that need to be met before communication is initiated:

initiating communication with EZmile 


**Requirementes:**

  1. LAWICEL AB canusb (model T70+) hardware
  2. install [cantools lib](https://pypi.org/project/cantools/) 
  3. install [can-utils lib](https://github.com/linux-can/can-utils)
  4. install linux drivers from ftdi, VCP, D2XX, D3XX [FTDI drivers](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/) "might not be needed"
  5. reference documents, EZmile files and documents: Gen0 automatic mode command description, LMS CAN interface definition document
  6. needed document: EZmile LMS dbc file
  
  
**Procedure to initiate communication with the vehicle:**

  first of all make sure the vehicle is in manual mode on both the external and internal panels.
  
    1. turn on vehicle using the outer red knob
    2. turn the switch from arriv to mar in the outside hatch
    3. make sure both switched are set to manual
    4. connect usb to laptop
    5. establish connection using the first set of commands
    6. Rearm vehicle and wait for bell sound
    7. send heartbeat signal
    8. optional: send config param signal
    9. switch to auto mode from outside
    10. switch the activ then the auto mode in the inside hatch
    11. press the door button then wait for the emergency light to on ready
    12. rearm the vehicle
    13. send movement command while the car is rearming, the command should be on while the vehicle is in auto mode
	  
  the linux commands file include the commands needed for this operation and the python files are needed to send commands
  
  remark: make sure to update the file path of dbc file inside the python files
